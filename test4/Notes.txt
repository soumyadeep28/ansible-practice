Ansible does apply variable precedence, and you might have a use for it. Here is the order of precedence from least to greatest (the last listed variables override all other variables):

command line values (for example, -u my_user, these are not variables)

role defaults (as defined in Role directory structure) 1

inventory file or script group vars 2

inventory group_vars/all 3

playbook group_vars/all 3

inventory group_vars/* 3

playbook group_vars/* 3

inventory file or script host vars 2

inventory host_vars/* 3

playbook host_vars/* 3

host facts / cached set_facts 4

play vars

play vars_prompt

play vars_files

role vars (as defined in Role directory structure)

block vars (only for tasks in block)

task vars (only for the task)

include_vars

set_facts / registered vars

role (and include_role) params

include params

extra vars (for example, -e "user=my_user")(always win precedence)
